**Problem Statement**
The project aims to perform statistical analysis of distribution of insurance plan rates across USA based on age.

**Dataset Details**
Dataset is provided by CCIIO and CMS which includes data frm 2014-2022. There are in total 12 csv files which contains Benefits and Cost Sharing, Rate, Plan Attributes, etc.
I used rate.csv dataset for my analysis which contains data from 2014-2016 and contains 12694445 rows and 24 columns.

**Null Hypothesis**
Individual plan rate is not dependent age groups (<40 and >40).

**Alternate Hypoothesis**
Individual plan rate is dependent age groups (<40 and >40).

**Project Workflow**


**Results and Conclusion**
1. The study analysis clearly indicate that the machine learning methods like Naïve Bayes (NB), Support Vector Machines (SVM), k-Nearest Neighbor’s algorithm (k-NN), and Random Forest (RF) 
   along with the traditional statistical methods like t-tests (paired t-test, independent sample t-test), analysis of variance (ANOVA) and correlation (Pearson and Spearman) enhance the results
   obtained by the traditional statistical methods to integrate multi-OMICs data. ​​
2. This clearly shows that we can reject the null hypothesis and it can be said that machine learning approaches can complement statistical methods in understanding
   the interpretation of multi-OMICS in nutrition research.
